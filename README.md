# Collaborative API Project

Create a backend express app that provides API functionality for the Blog project, and functional frontend app that consumes the API.

Serve the application at heroku.com.

## Frontend
- Use the existing design from the Collaborative Frontend Project
- Use the API (with `fetch`, `axios`, `request`...) to fetch and manage data

## Backend
- Express app
- API routes
- Static (frontend) route
- [Optional — create admin panel — `/admin`]
